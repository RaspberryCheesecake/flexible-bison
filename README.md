# Parsing GCODE using flex and bison

Run the `build` script to autogenerate a `gcode_reader` object
then parse the text using `$ .\gcode_reader`

Inspired by [this tutorial](http://aquamentus.com/flex_bison.html)

GCODE is a language used to control machine tools (including 3D printers). It's arguably one of the first programming languages I ever learnt, and I still have a soft spot for it - who couldn't love a language that lets you control the movements of a CNC lathe!
